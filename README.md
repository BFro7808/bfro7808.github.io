# WEB200
Benjamin Froehling

Taking Web200 to refresh and improve upon my skills with web scripting and JavaScript in general. I intend to use JavaScript for mostly personal projects, but I also may use it for work if I choose to head down a web development route. I've made a few notable projects using JavaScript, such as a game and language "flashcards".

Session 2 - What I remembered
Since I've a good amount of experience with vars, I did have to reuse some old tricks that I used to use when I first learned it. One of those being rounding a number to the hundredths place via a few lines of math trickery. Otherwise, I havenâ€™t applied a HTML tag inside of a variable string in a while. The techniques used in this session are fundamental to having a solid base from programming, as vars are the corner stone of computing.
