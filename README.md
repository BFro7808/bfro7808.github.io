# WEB200
Benjamin Froehling

Taking Web200 to refresh and improve upon my skills with web scripting and JavaScript in general. I intend to use JavaScript for mostly personal projects, but I also may use it for work if I choose to head down a web development route. I've made a few notable projects using JavaScript, such as a game and language "flashcards".

Session 2 - What I remembered
Since I've a good amount of experience with vars, I did have to reuse some old tricks that I used to use when I first learned it. One of those being rounding a number to the hundredths place via a few lines of math trickery. Otherwise, I haven’t applied a HTML tag inside of a variable string in a while. The techniques used in this session are fundamental to having a solid base from programming, as vars are the corner stone of computing.

Session 3
This session covered functions which are crucial to making re-usable and easier to maintain code. Functions allow for a set of code to be reused whenever the programmer chooses to call them. An example would be the number rounding function I used, which only requires that I send in a number to get back out a number without having to write the same lines of code repeatedly to round a set of numbers. Functions are something I will always use since their usefulness is important to maintainability and code readability.

Session 4
When I began working on this session, I was under the impression we were going to be using inline events. I hadn't use the event listeners until this point, but I actually liked them quite a lot. Organizing function calls inside the script file feels a lot cleaner and more secure as I read.

Session 5
Session 5 covered logical choices. These sets of decision statements are another foundation of programming. I would say they're probably universally useful as they allow for some lenience in an otherwise rigid and unchanging environment. I plan to use decision statements pretty much everywhere in the future as they are integral for creating various applications of code for programs.

Session 6 & 7
Good refresher of loops since I haven't done one in a little while. I got right back into the hang of things though and didn't have much of an issue figuring out the logic for looping through an array or nesting another loop within a loop. I overcomplicated session 6's activity a little bit but it still works so I don't see any issues with it. As for usefulness in the industry, loops are very handy for dealing with large sets of data, like an array, or repeating an action over and over without having to write the slightly different lines of code x number of times. Good stuff.

Session 8
Arrays are a fundamental aspect of any program that manages larger sets of data. Since they are quite easy to manipulate and can also even hold arrays within themselves, arrays are extremely handy, no matter how big or small they are. Though there is a limit to how big you would want to go with an array in JS since there is a hard integer limit at some point. Hitting that limit would be somewhat difficult though. Arrays are likely something that I would use often in work, maybe for something like unavailable products listed on a grocery store’s website.
