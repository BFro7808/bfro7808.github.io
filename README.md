# WEB200
Benjamin Froehling

Taking Web200 to refresh and improve unpon my skills with webscripting and JS in general. I intend to use Javascript for mostly personal projects, but also might be 
applied for work if I choose to head down a web development route. I've made a few notable projects using Javascript, such as a game and language "flashcards".
