# WEB200
Benjamin Froehling

Taking Web200 to refresh and improve upon my skills with web scripting and JavaScript in general. I intend to use JavaScript for mostly personal projects, but I also may use it for work if I choose to head down a web development route. I've made a few notable projects using JavaScript, such as a game and language "flashcards".
