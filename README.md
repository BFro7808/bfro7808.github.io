# WEB200
Benjamin Froehling

Taking Web200 to refresh and improve upon my skills with web scripting and JavaScript in general. I intend to use JavaScript for mostly personal projects, but I also may use it for work if I choose to head down a web development route. I've made a few notable projects using JavaScript, such as a game and language "flashcards".

Session 2 - What I remembered
Since I've a good amount of experience with vars, I did have to reuse some old tricks that I used to use when I first learned it. One of those being rounding a number to the hundredths place via a few lines of math trickery. Otherwise, I havenâ€™t applied a HTML tag inside of a variable string in a while. The techniques used in this session are fundamental to having a solid base from programming, as vars are the corner stone of computing.

Session 3
This session covered functions which are crucial to making re-usable and easier to maintain code. Functions allow for a set of code to be reused whenever the programmer chooses to call them. An example would be the number rounding function I used, which only requires that I send in a number to get back out a number without having to write the same lines of code repeatedly to round a set of numbers. Functions are something I will always use since their usefulness is important to maintainability and code readability.

Session 4
When I began working on this session, I was under the impression we were going to be using inline events. I hadn't use the event listeners until this point, but I actually liked them quite a lot. Organizing function calls inside the script file feels a lot cleaner and more secure as I read.
